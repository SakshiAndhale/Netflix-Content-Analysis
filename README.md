# üìä Netflix Movies & TV Shows Analysis (SQL)

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Netflix‚Äôs movie and TV show dataset using SQL. The idea is to explore patterns across content types, ratings, release years, countries, genres, and more ‚Äî using SQL queries to extract meaningful insights. It was a hands-on opportunity to practice writing queries and solving real-world business-style questions.

## Objectives

- Compare the number of movies vs. TV shows on Netflix  
- Find the most frequent content ratings  
- Analyze content by release year, country, and duration  
- Identify popular genres and directors  
- Explore keyword-based content categorization  
- Use case-based queries (e.g., ‚Äúlongest movie‚Äù, ‚Äútop actors from India‚Äù, etc.)

---

## Dataset

The data comes from a publicly available Netflix dataset on Kaggle.  
It contains titles, cast, director, genre, release year, and more for thousands of shows and movies.

## Sample Questions Explored

- How many movies vs. TV shows are there?  
- What are the most common content ratings for each type?  
- Which years had the most content releases in India?  
- What are the most represented countries?  
- Who are the most featured actors in Indian content?  
- Which titles are classified as Documentaries?  
- What content was added in the last 5 years?  
- Can we flag potentially violent content based on keywords?

These queries were designed to mimic the kind of insights a content strategy or data team might look for.

## Tools Used

- **PostgreSQL** for query writing and execution  
- **DB schema design** (based on the original CSV structure)

## Learnings

This project helped reinforce key SQL concepts like filtering, grouping, joins (when needed), CTEs, window functions, and working with semi-structured data like arrays and comma-separated fields. It also highlighted how SQL can support real-world storytelling with data.
